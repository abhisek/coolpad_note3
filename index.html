		Coolpad Note 3 is a smart phone which is recently launched in India. It is one of the best smartphone in terms of hardware within 10k range available in the market currently. It has many exciting (and perhaps scary) feature such as a fingerprint reader. It comes with a solid 3000 mAh battery and 3GB RAM.

    The box packaging was very good, at least as good as Nexus phones. However things didn't go too well once I switched on the phone for the first time. In the welcome screen, I was informed about <b><a href="http://www.xploree.com/">XPLOREE</a></b>, an app that will <i>assist</i> me in finding <i>great deals</i>.

    The phone appeared to lack (or perhaps I was unable to find the appropriate screen) some of the most common feature that I am used to in an Android phone like:
    <ul>
      <li>Full Disk Encryption</li>
      <li>Developer Options / USB Debugging</li>
      <li>Data Usage Statistics for Apps</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
